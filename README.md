## History
This project has been an on and off hobby project of mine for over 2 years now. It started as more of a Proof of Concept, just adding golfball without replacing existing characters (keep in mind, this was before cary released the source code, so this was based off of shoddy decompilations), to prove it could be done. The intent always had 2 levels to me. On the low level, it was to provide level makers with more tools to work with in their levels. 5b's original tileset and objects are by no means limited, but not even having the full cast of people in Evil Leafy likely limited people's creativity greatly, especially when the characters not included could've been some of the more interesting ones. On a deeper level though, my intent was to kinda show "hey, this is code that you can freely tinker with!" and kindof show there can be bigger changes to the game then levels. I sortof wanted to start a bigger movement of more technical investigation and modification of 5b, and judging by the growth of 5b Central and other projects adding new content to 5b, I just might have been successful (or maybe folks just made mods completely unrelated, who am I to say?). 

It's worth noting that at one point this mod was posted under a different name, and I think it's worth it to just explain that story to totally cover all bases. Originally I used a more broad, annonimized name inplace of my own name, and this was due to at the time stress involving how my name was connected to a community I held with great regret taking part in. I felt like I needed to hide who I was because I didn't want any people judging me, so I adopted a persona, and for awhile that stayed, even through a complete rebrand of my online handles. However eventually, I changed it because the word I picked out to annomize myself I grew to hate because of personal reasons I won't go into. Point is, this IS infact the latest version of that one mod, It's Jay now.

## Future Roadmap/Contributing
I don't see a likely future for this mod to be updated. I kindof just never feel like updating it. By now [HTML5b](https://github.com/coppersalts/HTML5b) is the best way to play 5b, and the best expansion for 5b is Mawilite's mod "5*". HTML5b is playable on modern browsers, has integration with [5beam](https://github.com/Zolo101/5beam), and is overall is the best way to play the original, even if it lacks some settings my mod has that I enjoy playing with, HTML5b is how I play 5b nowadays. As for Mawilite's mod, I believe it fills the void of new content that this mod intended filled. It has so many more characters, tons of unique features, what can't I say? It's a lovely mod, if you want to check it out, check 5b Central. If you wish to contribute to this mod, well, I'm afraid I actually don't have the source for the latest version on hand! It's currently on a laptop I no longer use, and frankly, by this point there isn't much reason to go back and get it. If you are super desperate to see how I did something, all I can really suggest is decompiling it right now. I'll try to get the source code public eventually.
